<p>Note: This page was created by ASIS&T UW to host information about tech resources. For our primary website, please visit <a href="http://students.washington.edu/asis/">http://students.washington.edu/asis/</a>.

<p>The Information School at the University of Washington offers a variety of technology courses, but they may not always address the topics you are interested in or go as in depth as you would like to go. This page was created to connect you with educational resources to supplement your academic programs as well as offer you a place to share resources you feel others could benefit from.</p>
